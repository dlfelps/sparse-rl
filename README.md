# Last-Mile Delivery Optimization with Sparse Reward Learning

We demonstrate that reinforcement learning agents can optimize last-mile delivery logistics with sparse reward signals (+1/-1 based on baseline comparison) as effectively as carefully tuned dense rewards, achieving +464.8 daily advantage over a greedy baseline with 1000× simpler signal design.

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Install package
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Train sparse reward agents (PPO + SAC, 500k timesteps each)
python train_sparse_policy.py

# Run comprehensive benchmark
python comprehensive_benchmark.py

# View results in comprehensive_results/
```

## Results Summary

Comprehensive benchmark across 5 problem instances (500 days of simulation):

| Agent | Daily Advantage | Win Rate | Stability | Training Signal |
|-------|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Sparse PPO** 🏆 | **+464.8** | 98.6% | σ=200.7 | +1/-1/0 |
| Dense PPO | +461.5 | 99.6% | σ=192.5 | -500 to +1000 |
| Dense SAC | +399.7 | 96.8% | σ=220.0 | -500 to +1000 |
| Sparse SAC | +362.4 | 96.6% | σ=198.8 | +1/-1/0 |
| Greedy Baseline | 0 (reference) | 50% | - | N/A |

### Key Findings

1. **Sparse rewards match dense rewards**: Sparse PPO (+464.8) equals or exceeds Dense PPO (+461.5)
2. **Simpler signals win**: +1/-1 achieves same performance as complex -500 to +1000 weights
3. **High reliability**: All agents beat baseline >96% of days
4. **Stable performance**: No degradation throughout 100-day episodes

**Key Insight**: You might not need a complex reward function. A simple comparative signal (+1 if better, -1 if worse) matched or exceeded carefully tuned dense rewards (-500 to +1000).
